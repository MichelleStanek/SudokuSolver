# SudokuSolver
This program uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku boards.

Initially used @techwithtim's tutorial on Backtracking Algorithm! 
Increased efficency and memory usage massively by removing the testing of already invalid options from the program. 

# Instructions
Download the solve.py file and enter your Sudoku board in the variable 'board'. 0's are equivalent to empty spaces.
Then run the file and it will print out the solved verison of your sudoku board.
